######Preventing and controlling substandard and counterfeit medical products


Medical products should meet the standards of quality, safety and efficacy. The quality of medical products is, however, a major public health concern to the World Health Organization and its Member States. Registered and unregistered medical products are sold in many markets in the African Region. The illegitimate manufacture, distribution, widespread availability and indiscriminate use of substandard/spurious/falsely labelled/falsified/counterfeit medical products have serious consequences on public health.

our admin panel proposed to establish effective systems to carry out specific studies and routine market surveillance to quantify the magnitude of the problem and to inform the development and implementation of appropriate policies and regulations. Based on the findings of the studies, Member States should develop information, education and communication strategies to increase awareness of policy makers, health workers and the general public about the dangers of using substandard/spurious/falsely labelled/falsified/counterfeit medical products. The strategy should involve all activities aimed at fighting illegal production, distribution and use of these medical products.


######Cellular Phones
Please do not use cellular phones in patient care areas. The use of cellular phones in patient care and medical procedure areas can disrupt medical equipment performance. The medical staff can direct you to public telephones or areas appropriate for usage.


######Safety Drills
Safety is a fundamental concern. We participate periodically in fire and emergency drills to test safety equipment and as part of our continuing Safety Education Program for all employees. If an alarm sounds while you are here, please stay calm and follow the instructions of the staff. We will take care of you.

#######Smoking
Because we care about your health and the health of others,  Medical Centers are smoke-free. Smoking in and around the hospital premises and affiliated sites is prohibited. Outdoor smoking areas at the medical center have been eliminated.

Hospital patients who smoke will receive nicotine replacement therapy and counseling by our smoking cessation team. Nicotine replacement products will be available in the hospital Gift Shop at Parnassus and Mount Zion for family members and visitors who smoke.

See more information about our smoke-free workplace.
